00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:21.000
Sunday morning rain is falling

3
00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:26.000
Steal some covers share some skin

4
00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:31.000
Clouds are shrouding us in
moments unforgettable

5
00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:37.000
You twist to fit the mold that I am in

6
00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:42.000
But things just get so crazy‚
living life gets hard to do

7
00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:47.000
And I would gladly hit the road‚
get up and go if I knew

8
00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:53.000
That someday it would
lead me back to you

9
00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:58.000
That someday it would
lead me back to you

10
00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:03.000
That may be all I need

11
00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:09.000
In darkness she is all I see

12
00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:13.000
Come and rest your bones with me

13
00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:16.000
Driving slow on Sunday morning

14
00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:21.000
And I never want to leave

15
00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:27.000
Fingers trace your every outline

16
00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:32.000
Paint a picture with my hands

17
00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:36.000
Back and forth we sway like
branches in a storm

18
00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:42.000
Change the weather still
together when it ends

19
00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:47.000
That may be all I need

20
00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:52.000
In darkness she is all I see

21
00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:57.000
Come and rest your bones with me

22
00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:00.000
Driving slow on Sunday morning

23
00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:08.000
And I never want to leave

24
00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:25.000
But things just get so crazy‚
living life gets hard to do

25
00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:31.000
Sunday morning rain is falling
and I am calling out to you

26
00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:36.000
Singing someday it′ll
bring me back to you

27
00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:42.000
Find a way to bring myself
back home to you

28
00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:47.000
That may be all I need

29
00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:52.000
In darkness she is all I see

30
00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:57.000
Come and rest your bones with me

31
00:02:57.000 --> 00:03:00.000
Driving slow on Sunday morning

32
00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:10.000
the end thanks
